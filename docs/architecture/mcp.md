# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Architecture

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the foundation of IntelliSync CMS's AI-driven workflow system. It enables modular, context-aware agents to collaborate across the client lifecycle.

## Core Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each MCP server is a standalone microservice
2. **Context Awareness**: Agents maintain and share context through the memory manager
3. **Stateless Operations**: All state is managed through the memory and context systems
4. **Event-Driven**: Agents communicate through events and message queues
5. **Secure**: All operations follow strict security and access control policies
6. **Observable**: All agent actions are logged and auditable
7. **Scalable**: Each server can be independently scaled based on load

## Server Types

### 1. Core Servers
- Client Intake Server
- Discovery Analysis Server
- Opportunity Scoring Agent
- Sales Funnel Server
- Project Management Server

### 2. Support Servers
- Memory Manager
- Context Controller
- Agent Orchestrator
- Workflow Template Server
- Agent Task Manager
- Agent Memory Store

### 3. Integration Servers
- Calendar Server
- File System Server
- Meeting Notes Summarizer

## Communication Flow
1. Client request triggers an agent through API
2. Agent loads context from Context Controller
3. Agent processes request using relevant models
4. Results are stored in Memory Manager
5. Context is updated
6. Response returned to client

## Security Model
- All inter-agent communication is encrypted
- Authentication required for all operations
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at database level
- Comprehensive audit logging for all agent actions
- Secure memory management with expiration policies
- Role-based access control for agent operations

## Deployment Architecture
- Each server runs as a separate container
- Horizontal scaling based on load
- Health monitoring and automatic recovery
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Distributed task queue for agent coordination
- Memory store replication for high availability
